# Onward Journey: Infrastructure Overview

This directory contains the terraform code to deploy an instance of the onwards journey application and supporting services.

### The "Shared VPC, Isolated Stack" Model

We utilise a model where foundational networking is **shared** across the account, while application resources are **isolated** per developer environment.

- **How:** A single, persistent **Shared VPC** is provisioned once in the `default` workspace. Individual developer resources (Orchestrators, Databases, etc.) are then deployed into this VPC using dedicated Terraform workspaces.
- **Why:** This approach avoids hitting AWS VPC limits and reduces deployment times by reusing the heavy networking infrastructure. It ensures a consistent network configuration across the team while maintaining total security and data isolation for each developer.

---

### 1. The Shared VPC & Subnets

To simplify connectivity and manage quotas, the networking layer is **shared and persistent**.

- **Shared Resources:** `main-vpc`, `app-pvt-2a/b` (Private), and `dmz-pub-2a` (Public).
- **VPC Endpoints:** We provision interface and gateway endpoints for **Bedrock**, **Secrets Manager**, and **S3**. This allows the isolated stack to communicate with AWS services securely without leaving the private network.
- **⚠️ Deployment Instructions:**
Because the network belongs to everyone, you must use the dedicated VPC configuration to prevent your local workspace from overwriting the shared state. When initialising the VPC layer, you must combine your environment config with the vpc config:
`terraform init -backend-config=../environments/<your-env>.config -backend-config=vpc.config`
- **Protection:** These resources use the `prevent_destroy = true` lifecycle guardrail to prevent accidental network disruption.
- **⚠️ Tear Down Warning:** If you must destroy the VPC, you must first manually comment out the `prevent_destroy` lines in `infrastructure/vpc/vpc.tf`. **Do not do this unless you are certain no other developer is using the network.**

### 2. Environment Isolation

We use the `var.environment` variable (set in your `local.auto.tfvars`) to prefix resources. This ensures that your work does not conflict with others.

- **Unique Resources:** IAM Roles, Security Groups, RDS Instances, and Bedrock AgentCore modules.
- **Naming Convention:** `[initials]-[resource-name]` (e.g. `ab-orchestrator-sg`).

### 3. Managed Agent Capabilities (AgentCore)

We leverage Amazon Bedrock’s managed "AgentCore" to handle the complexities of the agentic loop:

- **`agent_chat_context`**: This is the managed memory store. It can persist the history handed over from GOV.UK chat and will maintain the ongoing conversation state during the Onward Journey.
- **`tool_interface`**: A standardised gateway using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that allows the Orchestrator to securely query tools (like the Department Contacts database). **Note:** Inbound traffic is secured via AWS_IAM (SigV4) authentication.

**⚠️ Naming Note:** Due to inconsistent AWS validation rules, Memory resources use underscores (e.g. `agent_chat_context`) while Gateway resources use hyphens (e.g. `tool-interface`).

**Crucial:** Bedrock appends a 10-character unique hash to Memory IDs (e.g. `-yq9yRQ5h7z`). If you need to manually import a memory resource into your state, you must use the full ID found in the AWS Console.

### 4. Database & Secrets Management

The **Government Department Contacts Store** (RDS PostgreSQL 17.6) is our primary knowledge base. It is enhanced with the `pgvector` extension to support semantic search.

- **The "Empty Secret" Workflow:** To maintain security, we do not store the database password in code or state. Consequently, the initial Terraform deployment for an environment will partially fail as it tries to read a secret version that doesn't exist yet.
- **Accessing the DB:** You must manually set your password in **AWS Secrets Manager** after your first deployment.
- **Secret Name:** Look for `${var.environment}-dept-contacts-db-password` in the AWS Console.
- **Connectivity:** Access is strictly controlled via the `${var.environment}-rds-metadata-sg`. It only accepts inbound traffic from the orchestrator, seeder or KB sync pipeline on port 5432.

### 5. Data Ingestion & Database Initialisation

We use a configuration-driven pipeline to manage the database schema and the ingestion of mock datasets.

- **Mock Data Seeding (`rds_seeder`):** Managed via `infrastructure/services/seed_config.yaml`. This is used to wipe and repopulate mock CSV datasets (like department contacts) for PoC testing.
  - **CSV to RDS:** To seed data, add a CSV into `mock_data/` and reference it in the `source_file` field of your table entry in the YAML.
  - **Reset Logic:** The seeder is **destructive**. It uses `DROP TABLE ... CASCADE` to ensure the table state exactly matches the CSV file.
- **Database Initialisation (`rds_init`):** Managed via `infrastructure/services/kb_config.yaml`. This ensures that the database environment is correctly provisioned:
  - **Extensions:** Installs `pgvector`.
  - **Users:** Idempotently creates the `rds_readonly_dept_contacts` SQL user used by the Search Tool.
  - **Security:** Security: Enables AWS IAM token authentication for the rds_readonly_dept_contacts user.
  - **Tables:** Ensures tables used for KB syncs exist without risking data loss. It uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`.
- **Flexible Primary Keys:** By default, tables are created with a `SERIAL PRIMARY KEY` called `id`. However, you can define your own natural primary key (e.g., `kb_identifier`) in the column list to ensure idempotency and prevent duplicates.
- **Automatic Vectorisation:** If a table defines an `embedding` column and `embedding_source_cols`, the respective Lambda will automatically call Bedrock Titan v2 to generate vectors (for the seeder) or provision the correct vector types (for RDS init).
- **Automatic Triggers:** Terraform monitors YAML configs, Lambda code, and mock CSV files. Any change will automatically trigger the appropriate Lambda (`rds_seeder` for mock data, `rds_init` for RDS infra and user sync).

---

### 6. Managing the Read-Only User

The `rds_tool` Lambda is strictly restricted to read-only access using a dedicated SQL user called `rds_readonly_dept_contacts`.

This uses AWS IAM Database Authentication. The Lambda does not use a static password or access Secrets Manager for database connectivity. Instead, it generates a short-lived AWS IAM token at runtime to authenticate. Local permissions within PostgreSQL are restricted to SELECT operations only, ensuring a zero-leak state configuration.
    ```

### 7. Knowledge Base ETL Sync Pipeline (Step Functions)

In addition to the static seeder, we have a dynamic **Knowledge Base Sync Pipeline** designed to fetch and vectorise articles from remote CRM platforms (e.g., Genesys Cloud) on a schedule.

- **Orchestration:** Managed via an AWS Step Function (`kb-sync-machine`).
- **Workflow Steps:**
    1.  **CheckKBMeta:** Polls the remote CRM to get the `dateModified` of the target Knowledge Base.
    2.  **CheckSyncMeta:** Compares the remote timestamp with the `last_modified` date stored in the local `sync_kb_metadata` table.
    3.  **Choice (IsSyncRequired):** If the dates match, the execution ends. If they differ, the sync proceeds.
    4.  **FetchArticles:** Downloads all articles from the remote CRM.
    5.  **ProcessAndEmbedArticles (Map State):** Iterates through each article in parallel, calling Bedrock Titan v2 to generate embeddings and upserting the results into the `knowledge_base_articles` table.
- **Scheduling:** EventBridge rules are dynamically created based on the `active_pipelines` configuration in the Terraform locals.
- **Observability:** Logs for each step are available in CloudWatch under `/aws/lambda/[initials]-kb-sync-*` and the Step Function execution history.

### Troubleshooting & Maintenance

#### When the Seeder or Init Fails
If your tables or data aren't appearing in RDS after an apply, check the following:

1.  **CloudWatch Logs:**
    Look for "Connection Timeout" or Bedrock "Access Denied" errors:
    *   Mock Data: `/aws/lambda/[initials]-rds-seeder`
    *   RDS Infrastructure: `/aws/lambda/[initials]-rds-init`
2.  **VPC Routing:** Ensure the S3 Gateway Endpoint is associated with the private route table in the VPC layer.
3.  **Secrets Format:** Ensure the DB password in Secrets Manager is saved as a **Plaintext** string, not a JSON key-pair.

#### Manual Refresh
To force-rebuild a mock table or re-run the RDS initialisation:

```bash
# Force-rebuild a mock table:
terraform apply -replace='terraform_data.rds_sync_trigger["mock_rag_data_<version>.csv"]'

# Re-run RDS infrastructure and user initialisation
terraform apply -replace='terraform_data.rds_init_trigger'
```

#### Manual Knowledge Base sync

The Knowledge Bases may require manual syncing after applying terraform - to check if this is the case, go to the `rds-tool` lambda in AWS console and run a test command for each `kb_identifier` (currently `ho-visa-005`), for example:

```
{
  "method": "query_knowledge_base",
  "arguments": {
    "query": "how do i track my personal travel document application?",
    "kb_identifier": "ho-visa-005"
  }
}
```
The query should be successful, but check the details - if the result content only displays an empty array or unexpected content, you will need to manually sync. Follow these steps:

1: Ensure tables are provisioned
  If the tables `sync_kb_metadata` or `knowledge_base_articles` are missing, run:
  ```bash
  terraform apply -replace='terraform_data.rds_init_trigger'
  ```

2: Manually run the sync pipeline
  Go to step functions in AWS console and select the `kb-sync-machine` prefixed with your initials. Click start execution and run the following for each `kb_identifier`, i.e.:
  ```
  {
    "kb_identifier": "ho-visa-005",
    "platform": "genesys",
    "sync_type": "scheduled"
  }
  ```

  Now go to `rds-tool` lambda and run a `query_knowledge_base` test for each `kb_identifier` - you should now see the correct information in the result content.

#### Manual Build/Rebuild (Lambda Packaging)
If a Lambda build is unsuccessful or staging folders are corrupted, use the `taint` command.

```bash
# Force a rebuild of the Orchestrator package
terraform taint null_resource.install_orchestrator_deps
```

Or to rebuild everything at once, you can run:

```bash
# Force a rebuild of all packages
terraform apply \
  -replace="null_resource.install_orchestrator_deps" \
  -replace="null_resource.install_seeder_deps" \
  -replace="null_resource.install_rds_tool_deps" \
  -replace="null_resource.install_crm_tool_deps"
```
